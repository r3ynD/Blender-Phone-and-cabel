Modelling phone and cabel with Type-C with <Blender>

  <h3>To create a simple phone model in Blender for beginners, follow these steps:</h3>

1. Start by creating a cube object (Shift + A > Mesh > Cube) and scale it to the desired size and proportions of the phone.

2. Use the loop cut tool (Ctrl + R) to create edges where you want corners or features of the phone to be. You can then use the Scale tool to adjust these edges to create the desired shape.
3. Round off the edges of the phone using the Bevel tool (Ctrl + B). Adjust the number of segments and the depth of the bevel to achieve the desired effect.
4. Add more details such as buttons, camera lenses and ports using other basic shapes like cylinders or spheres, and position them accordingly.
5. Use the Boolean modifier to add holes or cutouts for features like speakers or charging ports. To do this, create another shape that intersects with the phone model and set the Boolean modifier to "Difference".
6. Create basic materials for your phone by selecting the phone object, opening the Properties panel and navigating to the Materials tab. Click "New" to create a new material and adjust the settings to achieve the desired appearance. You can add textures or images to your material by clicking on the Texture tab and adding a new texture.

  <h3>To create a cable in Blender, follow these steps:</h3>

1. Add a Bezier Curve by pressing Shift + A and selecting Curve > Bezier.
2. Enter Edit Mode by pressing Tab and adjust the shape of the curve to match the desired path of the cable.
3. Create a profile for the cable by adding a plane (Shift + A > Mesh > Plane) and scaling it along one axis to create a rectangular shape.
4. In Object Mode, add a Screw Modifier to the profile object and select the Bezier Curve as the axis of rotation.
5. Adjust the settings of the modifier to achieve the desired level of detail and smoothness for the cable.
6. Apply the modifier and optionally adjust the material and texture settings to give the cable a realistic appearance.
